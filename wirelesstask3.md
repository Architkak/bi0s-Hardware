# IQ SIGNAL 

*“IQ”* signals are basically Quadrature signals , used in radio frequency applications.

When waves of periodic signals differ by __90__ degrees in their phase angle those waves are known as quadrature . The reference signal that is *“I”* , when shifted by __90__ degrees, becomes the *“Q”* signal.

We can consider the following example

The cosine wave and the sine wave  are __90__ degrees apart from each other so we can say that they are *“IQ”*  signals as the amplitude of the cosine wave can be considered as *“I”*  or the In-phase signal and The amplitude of the sine wave is *“Q”*  or the quadrature signal.

If the *“I”* waveform  has a phase of __0°__ and the *“Q”* waveform has a phase of __90__ degrees, the resulting *“IQ”* waveform will have a phase angle of __45__ degrees.

When *“I”* and *“Q”* are varying identically then their sum varies but in case they are not varying identically the phase of their sum can also vary.

 So we can say that by  changing the values of __*I*__ and __*Q*__  appropriately we can change their sum to have frequency , amplitude , phase modulation or any combination .
