# HARDWARE TASK 1


We have to find the value of a = ABCD1110 and b= EBXACDYZ 
We are given with the values of 

* A= 0
* X= 0
* C= 1
* D= 1
* E= 1

So we have to find the values of B,Y,Z which I got by using the truth tables of different logic gates.

* B=1
* Y=1
* Z=0 
  
Which makes a as 011111110 and b as 11001110
So the decimal form of a and b are

* a = 158
* b = 206

By using the circuit and putting the values of the a and b in the serial monitor I got
